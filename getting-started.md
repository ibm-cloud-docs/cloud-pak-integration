## Before you begin
Before you can install the Cloud Pak on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, you must set up a Red Hat OpenShift Cluster. Go to [Red Hat OpenShift Cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/openshiftcluster){: external}.  You need to create a cluster.

You must purchase a license through [IBM Passport Advantage](https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/index.html){: external}. 


## Step 1. Assign a license
{: step1}

The license purchased through IBM Passport Advantage appears in the list of available entitlements. Click an entitlement block to select it.  Click **Assign**.

## Step 2. Configure your installation environment
{: step2}

Enter the identifier for the OpenShift cluster you have available in the RedHat OpenShift cluster field.

In the Project field, select from an existing project or create a new one by entering a unique project name. A project is similar to a Kubernetes cluster namespace, and the list is populated from your Red Hat OpenShift environment.  Note this project name is used as the namespace for the Platform Navigator.

## Step 3. Configure your workspace
{: step3}

Enter a name for the workspace.  A suggested name is provided.  You can change this value.

## Step 4. Run pre-installation script
{: step4}

Click **Run script**.

## Step 5. Set the deployment values
{: step5}

You must enter a value for the **csDefaultAdminPassword**.  Do not lose this value.

## Step 6. Install
{: step6}

Check the box verifying you have read the license agreements.  Click **Install**.

The namespace you use for installation of the Platform Navigator should match the name you set for the project.


## Next steps

Once the installation completes, click **Offering Dashboard** to open the Platform Navigator.

You can also discover the host URL for the Platform Navigator with the following command.

`oc get route icp-proxy -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'`

The full URL will then resemble "https://icp-proxy-host/icp4i".

The Platform Navigator home page offers the ability to create instances of the various components.
